Hi guys, in this midterm project, I wanna introduce a story about NYC Dogs. Because I have a golden retriever, Omelet and I really thank the happiness it brings to me. In this project, there are three questions will be answered:

1. How many dog runs are within New York City? and what are their locations? 
2. What kind of dog breeds are favored by New Yorkers? Do they also like golden retrivers like me?
3. Where can New Yorkers access the pet supply stores to get dog toys and snacks?

Alright, let's start the journey.
<First Slide>
According to the data, there are 87 dog runs in NYC. And most of them are distributed in Manhattan Island and Brooklyn. The dog owners can use this map to find out the nearest dog run around them and obtain the information about **area (like this one...)** and even **dig deeper through the google** to obtain other information. And they can check information about other dog runs. **like this one (go to another slide)**

<Second Slide>

Rockway Freeway Dog Park is the biggest dog run in NYC, **its area is 8259 sqm**. This is the picture of the Rockway Freeway Dog Park.

<Third Slide>

And then thanks to NYC's effort on the opendata. We also have information about the dog licenses. Based on the dog licenses, we can have zip code location of each licensed dog, and it also have specific informaitom of the dog name, gender, year etc. Here, I aggregate them and find out a very interesting insight. The most popular breed in NYC is Yorkshire Terrier. There are 30379 Yorshire Terrier in NYC. 

There are two ways to know the information around your zipcode. One way is to **click the marker in the map.** You can have information like the total number of dogs, the average ages, the percentage of the male dogs and of the femal dogs. **Another way** is to **enter the zipcode (10010)** to see the information. Of course, you can also scale back to the origin by **typing the all in the zipcode console.**

In this dataset, I find out a very interesting insight. There are 6 dogs are registered in the Washington. They are American Pit Bull Mix like this one in the snow. And two of them are named Betty and Luca.

<Fifth Slide>

Finally, as dog owners, we always want to buy snacks and toys for our dogs. According to the data, there are 109 pet stores in NYC. They are all in the map. Every downer can **click through each one** to obtain **specifc information like**.

That is it. THanks!
